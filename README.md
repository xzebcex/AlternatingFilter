# **Alternating Filter**
This SQL code retrieves all records from the "students" table where the first name is "Dale" or the last name is "Cook". It uses the OR clause as a logical operator to specify an alternative condition to filter the records.

To use this code, specify the table name after the "FROM" keyword and add any additional conditions to the WHERE clause as needed. The SELECT statement retrieves all columns from the table. However, you can modify this statement to select specific columns by listing them after the SELECT keyword separated by commas.

The first line of code has a note stating that the requirements for the WHERE clause can be specified on this line. As a result, you may change this code to look for different names or add more qualifiers to the WHERE clause as needed.
